The project is under development.

The orderbook in this project builds upon https://github.com/anthdm/rust-trading-engine, which to my knowledge is incomplete and will probably never be completed.

There should be a "config.json" file located in the root directory with a valid Deribit API client_id and client_secret:
```
{
"client_id": "your_client_id",
"client_secret": "your_client_secret"
}
```
Note that the API key should have the correct privileges.
